### October 7, 2025 - Critical Mobile Fixes & Full Mobile Optimization
- **CRITICAL: Viewport Configuration Added**: Fixed missing viewport meta tag that was breaking mobile rendering completely. Now properly configured with device-width and initial-scale while allowing user zoom for accessibility
- **CRITICAL: Header Visibility Fixed**: Resolved issue where navigation header was invisible on mobile devices, making navigation impossible. Added:
  - Increased z-index to 100 with explicit sticky positioning
  - Safe-area support for devices with notches (iPhone X+)
  - Proper top padding (pt-20) to prevent content from hiding under header
  - Mobile-specific CSS rules to ensure header always stays visible
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Improved header with larger touch targets (48px minimum), better icon sizing, and horizontal scrolling support
- **Responsive Dashboard**: Mobile-first layout with reordered card placement, responsive text sizes, and touch-friendly pagination controls  
- **Optimized Feature Cards**: Responsive sizing using clamp() for proper mobile viewport scaling with touch-manipulation for fast tap response
- **Mobile Touch Support**: Comprehensive touch-action: manipulation applied to all interactive elements (buttons, links, cards, navigation) to eliminate 300ms tap delay and prevent unwanted zoom on iOS Safari
- **Handpan Interface Mobile Optimization**: 
  - Hidden left/right sidebars on mobile (< lg screens) to maximize handpan space
  - Responsive control buttons showing only icons on mobile
  - Optimized SVG scaling with proper viewport constraints
  - Enhanced touch targets for all interactive elements (44px minimum)
- **Song Library Enhancements**: Responsive headers, stat badges, and filter buttons optimized for mobile screens
- **CSS Utilities**: Added scrollbar-hide utility, touch-manipulation class, safe-area utilities, and comprehensive mobile-specific breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: Viewport configuration follows WCAG guidelines, allowing pinch-zoom while maintaining proper mobile layout

### October 7, 2025 - Comprehensive Mobile Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading & Code Splitting**: Implemented React.lazy for all heavy components (InteractiveHandpan, SongLibrary, Devotions, ExportProgress, RecentlyPlayed, Settings) to reduce initial bundle size
- **Loading States**: Added ComponentLoader with spinning animation for better UX during component loading
- **Suspense Boundaries**: Wrapped all lazy components with Suspense for proper loading state management
- **3D Background Optimization**: Lazy loaded Spline 3D iframe with 100ms delay and loading="lazy" attribute to prevent blocking initial render
- **Resource Hints**: Added preconnect and DNS prefetch for my.spline.design to improve external resource loading
- **CSS Performance (Mobile)**:
  - Reduced backdrop-filter blur from 70px to 20px on mobile devices (< 768px) for better 60fps performance
  - Added GPU acceleration with transform: translateZ(0) and backface-visibility: hidden
  - Added will-change: transform for animated elements
  - Optimized glassmorphism effects specifically for mobile
- **Scroll & Touch Optimization**:
  - Added -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch for smooth momentum scrolling
  - Added overscroll-behavior: contain to prevent bounce effects
  - Disabled tap highlights with -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent
  - Added -webkit-touch-callout: none for better touch experience
- **Animation Performance**: Added content-visibility: auto, smooth scroll-behavior, and font smoothing optimizations
- **Touch Interaction**: Disabled text selection on interactive elements for better mobile UX

### October 7, 2025 - Comprehensive Debugging & Code Cleanup
- **Runtime Error Fix**: Resolved critical "TypeError: e[o] is not a function" error through server restart (stale build state)
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed all debug console.log statements from components (page.tsx, interactive-handpan.tsx, song-library.tsx)
- **Error Handling**: Kept console.error in handpan-player.tsx for proper error reporting
- **Configuration Fix**: Moved allowedDevOrigins from experimental to top-level in next.config.mjs (Next.js 15 requirement)
- **Cross-Origin Warning**: Fixed allowedDevOrigins configuration to eliminate development warnings
- **Technical Debt**: 37 TypeScript LSP diagnostics remain (non-breaking, scheduled for future cleanup)
- **Verification**: All features tested and working correctly, no runtime errors

### October 6, 2025 - Replit Migration
- **Migrated from Vercel to Replit**: Successfully configured the Next.js 15 application to run in Replit's environment
- **Port Configuration**: Updated dev and start scripts to bind to port 5000 with host 0.0.0.0 for Replit compatibility
